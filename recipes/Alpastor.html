        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you’ve ever had tacos al pastor, you know how special this iconic Mexican street food is. Bursting with bold flavors of marinated pork, fresh pineapple, and spices, al pastor is a must-try for taco lovers! Traditionally cooked on a vertical spit like shawarma, this dish reflects Mexico’s fusion of indigenous and immigrant influences. But don’t worry—you can recreate this delicious meal at home without a spit!

            Al pastor is slowly becoming one of my go-to’s when ordering tacos. I have always been firmly against eating pineapple with anything savory (sorry, it’s just my opinion!) but I’ve made an exception for al pastor. This pork and pineapple pairing is SO delicious, you need to try it!</p>

            <h2>Steps for making Al Pastor Tacos</h2>
            <em>Marinade</em>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Toast both sides of the guajillo and ancho chilis on a comal or cast iron skillet over medium heat until fragrant, being careful not to burn them. Rinse, then cover completely with hot water and soak until soft and pliable. </li>
                <li>Step 2: Toast the cinnamon, black pepper, cloves, cumin, and allspice until fragrant. Transfer them to a blender cup. Add the hydrated peppers (discarding the soaking liquid), garlic, achiote paste, oregano, ground onion, pineapple juice, orange juice, apple cider vinegar, avocado oil, and salt. Blend until smooth. Transfer the paste to a bowl and set aside until needed.</li>
            </ol>

            <em>Prep the Pineapple</em>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Prepare the pineapple by cutting off the bottom, about 1.5 inches thick. Remove the leaves and discard. Peel the remaining pineapple, then cut off the top portion, about 2 inches thick, trim for a rounder shape, and set aside. Quarter the remaining pineapple, remove the core, and slice. </li>
            </ol>

            <em>Prep the Pork</em>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Trim excess fat from the pork, then slice into 1/4-inch thick pieces.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Coat each pork slice in the marinade, then place in a non-reactive container. Repeat the process until all meat is thoroughly coated. Cover and refrigerate overnight to marinate.</li>
            </ol>

            <em>Trompo Time</em>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Position the al pastor stainless steel skewer over the Weber cast iron griddle, ensuring it’s centered. Insert the unpeeled pineapple bottom through the skewer and pull it down until it reaches the bottom. </li>
                <li>Step 2: Insert the marinated meat, one piece at a time, keeping it centered and layered upward, leaving space at the top. Top with the 2-inch peeled pineapple piece and secure. Trim excess meat for an even surface. Reserve the scraps and cook on a pan. </li>
            </ol>

            <em>Grill</em>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Fire up the grill and roast the salsa ingredients – tomatoes, tomatillos, garlic, onion, and serranos – over the grates until charred and cooked through. Then, remove them from the heat and set aside. </li>
                <li>Step 2: Wait for the grill to reach a temperature of 400°F to 350°F and maintain it within this range. Note that a lower temperature will result in less browning. Position the griddle in the center of the grill, following the Weber instructions. Cover and cook for one hour. </li>
            </ol>

            <em>Make the salsa</em>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Blend the roasted ingredients with salt to taste. Before blending, remove the peel from the garlic, stem from the onion, and stem from the serranos. Pulse the mixture for a chunky consistency, then pour into a container. Adjust the salt if needed. Set aside.  </li>

            </ol>

            <em>Check the meat</em>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: After one hour, check the meat to ensure it’s not browning too quickly. It should have a glossy brown color. If it’s browning too fast, adjust the temperature to slow it down. </li>
                <li>Step 2: Close the grill and continue cooking. After 30 minutes, trim off any charred bits if necessary to allow a second crispy layer to develop. Cover and cook for an additional 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F. The total cooking time should be around 2 hours. </li>
                <li>Step 3: When the meat is almost done, place the pineapple slices on the surrounding grates and grill until they’re tender and caramelized. </li>
                <li>Step 4: Serve on tacos and enjoy!!</li>
